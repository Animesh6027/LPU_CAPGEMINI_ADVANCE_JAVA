/*
OOPS:
	Object Oriented Programming
	It is a design model or paradigm which helps the programmer to corelate real world scenarios into programming world scenarios in the form of objects.
	
	States -> variables
	Behavious -> methods
	Pillars of OOPS:
		Encapsulation:
			The binding or wrapping states and behaviours of an object is known as Encapsulation.

			Ques: Why we use Encapsulation?
			Ans:  To achieve data hiding.

			Ques: What is data hiding?
			Ans:  The process of avoiding direct access but providing controlled access is known as data hiding.

			Ques: How to avoid direct access?
			Ans:  Using private access Modifier/Specifiers.
				  
				  ->Private is a keyword.
					If we make any member as a private so we can not use that variable directly in different class. We can only use directly in same class.

			Ques: How to provide Controlled access?
			Ans:  Using getter and setter method.

			Ques: What is the use of getter method?
			Ans:  It is used for get or retrieve private variable.

			Ques: What is the use of setter method?
			Ans:  It is used to set or modify private variable.

		Polymorphism
		Abstraction
